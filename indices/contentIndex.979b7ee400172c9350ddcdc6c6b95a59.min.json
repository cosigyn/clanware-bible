Other forms of evidence that may be considered include witness statements from individuals who have directly experienced or observed the behavior in question, as well as any relevant documentation or records from law enforcement or other regulatory agencies.

This process is designed to ensure that all decisions are fair and impartial, and that offenders have an opportunity to present any new or additional information that may support their case.\n2. To begin the appeals process, the appellant (the individual who has been found guilty) must submit a written appeal to the DGN panel. In this appeal, the appellant must provide evidence and arguments in support of their appeal, such as new evidence that was not available at the time of the original decision, or errors or mistakes made during the original investigation.\n3. The DGN panel will then review the appeal and the supporting evidence, and may hold a hearing to allow both the appellant and the respondent (the party representing the DGN rules and guidelines) to present their cases and arguments. After considering all of the evidence and arguments presented, the DGN panel will make a decision on the appeal.\n4. If the appeal is successful, the DGN panel may overturn the original decision and impose a different penalty. In general, the success of an appeal will depend on the appellant's ability to provide compelling and convincing evidence and arguments in support of their appeal, and to demonstrate that the original decision was incorrect or unjust. If the appeal is unsuccessful, the original decision will stand and the appellant will be required to abide by the terms of the original decision.","lastmodified":"2023-01-16T19:21:38.5144882Z","tags":null},"/notes/war-clans":{"title":"War-Clan Walkthrough","content":"\nThis section will explain the technicalities regarding \"War Clans\", going into depth on what they are, and how to get involved. \n\n### 3.1 What are War-Clans\n---\nWar groups are groups who engage in wars and battles with other groups. Most of the biggest war groups have bases or forts that may be attacked by other groups, and regularly hold activities in which members of the group can participate. \n\n### 3.2 Tips for Find and Joining a Clan\n---\nWithin the Clanware discord server, clans which are affiliated or semi-affiliated with Clanware have the ability to post in our recruitment channel. Through browsing this channel you are able to see a large multitude of clans advertising their groups and choose one accordingly. \n\nBased on the information within their recruitment messages, you can get a grasp of what the clan is and what they offer. Additionally, news regarding different clans are posted within our clan-news channel so based on the general information posted on clans, you can have a good indicator if the clan posted is the right one for you. \n\nWithin Clanware, various events are hosted which allow clans the opportunity to participate such as Clanware League (or CWL). Clans who have success in the CWL are posted in our hall-of-fame channel so this too can be used as a gather information on clans to determine whether you wish to join or not.\n\n### 3.3 Strategies for Successful Clan Wars\n---\nAs stated in the \"What are War-Clans\" section, clans occasionally participate in warfare competitions against other clans which are known as \"wars\". If you are a clan leader or an aspiring one, there are many different precautions you can take to ensure you have a \"successful war\". \n\nEvery clan war is governed by specific rules agreed upon by both sides. Ensuring your war terms are detailed regarding what is allowed or what is not allowed is always recommend and the foundation of every good war. To those starting out, Clanware offers \"War-Terms Templates\" for clans so that issues which occur the most are covered within the war terms.\n\nAnother thing recommended to have a successful war is the banning of exploiters. Clanware have a large database of individuals which have been deemed cheaters within our community. Using the Clanware Banlist will stop the most known cheaters from participating. Due to the ability of people using alternative accounts (alts), it is recommended to include in your war terms that no alts are allowed so that if the situation arises that a clan used a cheater on an alt the situation is handled and they are punished accordingly.\n\nFinally, one thing we suggest is to evaluate the clan which you are considering warring, asking yourself if they appear as an honourable clan. If a clan has a history of cheating or they have cheaters within high positions of their group, they may attempt to use these people in wars, so ensuring the clan you are going to war does not have any of these traits may help you in the long run.\n\n### 3.4. Ways to Promote your Clan and Attract New Members\n---\nClanware offer a large amount of areas to promote clans within Clanware. The most used resource to promote clans within Clanware is the recruitment channel. This allows non-blacklisted clans to promote their group's roblox link and discord server. Through posting it in this channel, you allow exposure towards your group and thus increase the chances of people clicking your link and joining.\n\nAnother way which you can promote your clan is through posting submissions of what your clan is getting up to in our clan-news channel. Things which can be posted here include but are not limited to: ceremonies which your clan host, large rallies which seem impressive, funny moments within your group, etc. Clan-News is one of the most looked at channels so using this to the benefit of your clan can get your name out there and increase the chances of people joining.\n\nGetting involved within Clanware clan events such as Clanware League (CWL) also is a great way to represent your group if you have success within there. By winning or placing high in such events, you will be advertised in the hall-of-fame channel indefinitely meaning anyone who browses the channel will see your group and understand the accomplishment you have achieved.","lastmodified":"2023-01-16T19:21:38.5144882Z","tags":null},"/notes/xplt-justice-policy":{"title":"XPLT Justice Policy","content":"\n*See also - [[notes/dgn-justice-policy|DGN Justice Policy]]*\n\nThis document outlines the protocol for reviewing, discussing, and voting on XPLT Justice submissions and appeals to ensure clarity on what is accepted and/or denied.
