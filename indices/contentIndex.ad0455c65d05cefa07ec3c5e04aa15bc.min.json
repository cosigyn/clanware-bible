Both splits will be on the same map and are a 800 Dualcap terminal.\n\nYour team will **gain one point per split** they win, as there are two splits in a game, this can result in a tie. This is resolved by comparing the collective team KDR for both splits, whichever team has a higher KDR win the game.\n\nYour team will gain one **extra point per game win.**\n\nTo summarize;\n\nGain one point per split win\nGain one point per game win\nThis means, the following outcomes are possible:\n\nWin both splits: 3 points\nWin one split and win by kdr: 2 points\nWin one split and lose by kdr: 1 points\nLose both splits: 0 point\n\n - League Structure\n\nThis league follows a *round-robin* structure, meaning you will play against each other team twice, in no particular order.\nLeagues are split into two Conferences Alpha and Conference Omega, the top two teams from each Conference will qualify for the knockout rounds.\n\nSwords will be anti ForceTie.\n\n**It is the sole responsibility of the team captains to ensure their game join code is not distributed to the wrong people, this will result in penalties.**\n\nAs always, NO exploiters will be permitted to participate.\n\nOur website: https://clanware.org/league\nGame: https://www.roblox.com/games/8214744835/SLASH-Hub\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/clanwareleague\nCWL Server: https://discord.gg/aPWrybmg\n\n---\nTBD\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-12T15:10:18.488758751Z","tags":null},"/notes/clanware-panels":{"title":"Clanware Panels","content":"\nClanware has a number of panels that are responsible for various aspects of the organization and the community.

This page will guide you through setting up and using @CLANWARE, utilizing the group checker and banlist, and participating in Clanware events and competitions.\n\n## 2.1. Setting up and using @CLANWARE\n---\nIn order to access and utilize the full range of Clanware services, you must first set up the @CLANWARE bot in your Discord server. This is done by inviting the bot to your server and granting it the appropriate permissions. You can use this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=872935754806992947\u0026permissions=277025441793\u0026scope=applications.commands%20bot), or the button on the bot profile.\n\n![Invite Image](https://ss.clanware.org/i8NGkn.png)\n\nOnce the bot is set up, you can use the various commands and functions offered by Clanware, such as the group checker and banlist, which are designed to help increase the safety and security of your clan.\n\n### Outline of commands\n**/ecase \u0026 /dcase**\nSearch for a specific exploiter or degenerate case on the Clanware Banlist.\n\n**/checkgroup**\nSearch a Roblox group for exploiters and degenerates.\n\n**/raidrequest**\nSearch for a raid for your clan in the Clanware Server.\n\n**/axis**\nFind exploiters on strike 4+, who are blacklisted from the community.\n\n**/checkevidence**\nProvides additional information about a specific case's evidence.\n\n## 2.2. Using the group checker and banlist to increase clan safety\n---\nThe group checker and banlist are two important tools offered by Clanware that can help you keep your clan safe from exploiters and cheaters. The group checker will scan the members of your clan and flag any users who have been banned from the Clanware community for exploiting or cheating.\n\nThere is both the discord bot command and [ingame](https://www.roblox.com/games/12024634611/Clanware-Registry-Hub) group checker.\n![Ingame Group Checker](https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/W_jRr7lqle2mVbLk0IoeSMdmOIxa_iNkzMyofU0muPs/https/ss.clanware.org/spHQuF.png?width=1276\u0026height=671)\n![Discord Bot Group Checker](https://ss.clanware.org/pV8luk.png)\n\nThe [banlist](), on the other hand, automatically bans people on our database of known exploiters and degenerates within the clanning community. By using the group checker, you can easily check to see if any potential members of your clan have a history of exploiting or cheating, and make an informed decision about whether or not to allow them to join your clan.\n\n## 2.3. Participating in Clanware events and competitions\n---\nClanware hosts a variety of events and competitions throughout the year, which provide an opportunity for clans to come together and compete in a friendly and organized manner.

Whether you're a seasoned pro or a newcomer to the world of Roblox clanning, Clanware events are a great way to get involved and have fun!\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-12T15:10:18.488758751Z","tags":null},"/notes/dgn-justice-policy":{"title":"DGN Justice Policy","content":"\n*See also - [[notes/xplt-justice-policy|XPLT Justice Policy]]*\n\nThis document outlines the protocol for reviewing, discussing, and voting on DGN Justice submissions and appeals to ensure clarity on what is accepted and/or denied. This document is subject to change without notice.\n\n\n## Charges and Definitions\n---\n\n### Tier 3 - 6 months\n* **Scamming**: Using fraudulent or deceptive practices to obtain money or other assets from another player.\n* **Account Theft**: Unauthorized access to and use of another player's account.\n* **Admin Abuse (nuking)**: Using administrative powers to cause harm or disruption to a group\n* **Blackmail**: Using threats or coercion to obtain money or other assets from another player.\n* **Malicious Distribution**: Sharing malware, exploits, or other harmful files with the intent to cause harm to other players or their devices.\n* **IP grabbing**: Attempting to obtain another player's IP address without their consent.\n* **Sexual Harassment**: Making unwanted sexual advances, comments, or gestures towards another player, or engaging in any other form of unwelcome sexual conduct that creates a hostile or offensive environment.

This could include screenshots or recordings of messages or social media posts containing personal or sensitive information, or logs from web servers or other online services showing attempts to access or distribute such information. Other forms of evidence that may be considered include witness statements from individuals who have directly experienced or observed the behavior in question, as well as any relevant documentation or records from law enforcement or other regulatory agencies. It is important that all evidence be carefully examined to ensure its authenticity and credibility, and that it be clearly presented and properly contextualized in order to support a fair and impartial decision.\n\n## Appeals Process\n---\n1. This process is designed to ensure that all decisions are fair and impartial, and that offenders have an opportunity to present any new or additional information that may support their case.\n2. To begin the appeals process, the appellant (the individual who has been found guilty) must submit a written appeal to the DGN panel. In this appeal, the appellant must provide evidence and arguments in support of their appeal, such as new evidence that was not available at the time of the original decision, or errors or mistakes made during the original investigation.\n3. The DGN panel will then review the appeal and the supporting evidence, and may hold a hearing to allow both the appellant and the respondent (the party representing the DGN rules and guidelines) to present their cases and arguments. After considering all of the evidence and arguments presented, the DGN panel will make a decision on the appeal.\n4. If the appeal is successful, the DGN panel may overturn the original decision and impose a different penalty. In general, the success of an appeal will depend on the appellant's ability to provide compelling and convincing evidence and arguments in support of their appeal, and to demonstrate that the original decision was incorrect or unjust. If the appeal is unsuccessful, the original decision will stand and the appellant will be required to abide by the terms of the original decision.\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-12T15:10:18.488758751Z","tags":null},"/notes/innovation-panel":{"title":"Innovation Panel","content":"\nThis document outlines the innovation panel's structure, purpose, and how to get involved.\n\n\n## Structure\n---\n\n### Director\n* Cosigyn\n\n### Head\n* ATGuardian\n\n### Developers\n* Anyone commissioned or requested to develop by Clanware\n\n## Purpose\n---\n\n### How it Works\n\nThe head of the Innovation Panel works closely with the executives to identify areas of growth. The head, or executives, may decide to outsource work to community developers by commissioning developers or by requesting free work from developers.\n\n### The Importance\n\nThe Innovation Panel and its members consisting of primarily the head and the executives, including the wider community's opinion, look for areas of great development in the clan community and by doing this are able to fund, create and release free products for clans to use to better their experience. This is important in helping the community enjoy the game more.\n\n## Get Involved\n---\n\n### Developers\n\nIf you are a developer, it's important you showcase your skills in the Clanware discord server by heading over to the developer guild category and then posting pictures of any developments you created in the showcase channel. This will help you get noticed. \n\nThere is a chance your skills will be required by the Innovation Panel and you may be paid for your work. Although Clanware would like to pay every developer, this may not always be the case as the system is completely run by community funds so if you can, please work for less or, even better, for free- that way you get a lot of promotion for your development skills and it will be a win-win situation.\n\n### Funds\n\nClanware is completely community-run- that includes its funds. This means that the Innovation Panel especially would like for more people to fund its endeavours and you can do so by heading over to this [game](https://www.roblox.com/games/12024634611/Clanware-Registry-Hub) and funding whatever you wish.\n\n### Feedback, Opinions and Queries\n\nThere is so much that the executives and the head of the Innovation Panel can do to find areas of weakness in terms of development within the clanning community so it's imperative that the wider community could input and share their knowledge- this can be done by direct messaging the head of the community panel or going to the community category, then the clans and guilds forum, and locating the thread called, \"What technologies should Clanware work on next?\". Either way works.\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-12T15:10:18.492758765Z","tags":null},"/notes/our-services":{"title":"Our Services","content":"\nThis section will provide information on how Clanware can provide services to the community through its various forms of technology.\n\n#4.1 Clan Technology\n---\nClanware provides many platforms for start-up, or already developed, clans to get better technology.\n\nClanware creates and provides technology which can be found in the development channel of the information category found within the discord server. Keep an eye out for regular updates as new technologies made by developers solely dedicated to Clanware and its goal of benefitting clans are made. \n\nYou can commission developers through the marketplace forum found in the developer guild category of the Clanware discord server. This option allows you to have customised technology to your liking and allows your clans to shine above others- you will, however, have to most likely pay for any services the developer is offering to you.\n\nAnother option for getting access to better forms of clan technology is by, again, going through the resources channel found in the developers guilde of the clanware discord server. There is plenty of new resources being opensourced to the community and the best thing about this is that it is all free.\n\n## 4.2 Raid Technology\n---\nTBD\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-12T15:10:18.492758765Z","tags":null},"/notes/war-clans":{"title":"War-Clan Walkthrough","content":"\nThis section will explain the technicalities regarding \"War Clans\", going into depth on what they are, and how to get involved. \n\n### 3.1 What are War-Clans\n---\nWar groups are groups who engage in wars and battles with other groups. Most of the biggest war groups have bases or forts that may be attacked by other groups, and regularly hold activities in which members of the group can participate. \n\n### 3.2 Tips for Find and Joining a Clan\n---\nWithin the Clanware discord server, clans which are affiliated or semi-affiliated with Clanware have the ability to post in our recruitment channel. Through browsing this channel you are able to see a large multitude of clans advertising their groups and choose one accordingly. \n\nBased on the information within their recruitment messages, you can get a grasp of what the clan is and what they offer. Additionally, news regarding different clans are posted within our clan-news channel so based on the general information posted on clans, you can have a good indicator if the clan posted is the right one for you. \n\nWithin Clanware, various events are hosted which allow clans the opportunity to participate such as Clanware League (or CWL). Clans who have success in the CWL are posted in our hall-of-fame channel so this too can be used as a gather information on clans to determine whether you wish to join or not.\n\n### 3.3 Strategies for Successful Clan Wars\n---\nAs stated in the \"What are War-Clans\" section, clans occasionally participate in warfare competitions against other clans which are known as \"wars\". If you are a clan leader or an aspiring one, there are many different precautions you can take to ensure you have a \"successful war\". \n\nEvery clan war is governed by specific rules agreed upon by both sides. Ensuring your war terms are detailed regarding what is allowed or what is not allowed is always recommend and the foundation of every good war. To those starting out, Clanware offers \"War-Terms Templates\" for clans so that issues which occur the most are covered within the war terms.\n\nAnother thing recommended to have a successful war is the banning of exploiters. Clanware have a large database of individuals which have been deemed cheaters within our community. Using the Clanware Banlist will stop the most known cheaters from participating. Due to the ability of people using alternative accounts (alts), it is recommended to include in your war terms that no alts are allowed so that if the situation arises that a clan used a cheater on an alt the situation is handled and they are punished accordingly.\n\nFinally, one thing we suggest is to evaluate the clan which you are considering warring, asking yourself if they appear as an honourable clan. If a clan has a history of cheating or they have cheaters within high positions of their group, they may attempt to use these people in wars, so ensuring the clan you are going to war does not have any of these traits may help you in the long run.\n\n### 3.4. Ways to Promote your Clan and Attract New Members\n---\nClanware offer a large amount of areas to promote clans within Clanware. The most used resource to promote clans within Clanware is the recruitment channel. This allows non-blacklisted clans to promote their group's roblox link and discord server. Through posting it in this channel, you allow exposure towards your group and thus increase the chances of people clicking your link and joining.\n\nAnother way which you can promote your clan is through posting submissions of what your clan is getting up to in our clan-news channel. Things which can be posted here include but are not limited to: ceremonies which your clan host, large rallies which seem impressive, funny moments within your group, etc. Clan-News is one of the most looked at channels so using this to the benefit of your clan can get your name out there and increase the chances of people joining.\n\nGetting involved within Clanware clan events such as Clanware League (CWL) also is a great way to represent your group if you have success within there. By winning or placing high in such events, you will be advertised in the hall-of-fame channel indefinitely meaning anyone who browses the channel will see your group and understand the accomplishment you have achieved.","lastmodified":"2023-03-12T15:10:18.492758765Z","tags":null},"/notes/xplt-justice-policy":{"title":"XPLT Justice Policy","content":"\n*See also - [[notes/dgn-justice-policy|DGN Justice Policy]]*\n\nThis document outlines the protocol for reviewing, discussing, and voting on XPLT Justice submissions and appeals to ensure clarity on what is accepted and/or denied.
