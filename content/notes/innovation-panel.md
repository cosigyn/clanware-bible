## Purpose
---

### How it Works

The head of the Innovation Panel works closely with the executives to identify areas of growth. The head, or executives, may decide to outsource work to community developers by commissioning developers or by requesting free work from developers.

### The Importance

The Innovation Panel and its members consisting of primarily the head and the executives, including the wider community's opinion, look for areas of great development in the clan community and by doing this are able to fund, create and release free products for clans to use to better their experience. This is important in helping the community enjoy the game more.

## Get Involved

### Developers

If you are a developer, it's important you showcase your skills in the Clanware discord server by heading over to the developer guild category and then posting pictures of any developments you created in the showcase channel. This will help you get noticed. 

There is a chance your skills will be required by the Innovation Panel and you may be paid for your work. Although Clanware would like to pay every developer, this may not always be the case as the system is completely run by community funds so if you can, please work for less or, even better, for free- that way you get a lot of promotion for your development skills and it will be a win-win situation.

### Funds

Clanware is completely community-run- that includes its funds. This means that the Innovation Panel especially would like for more people to fund its endeavours and you can do so by heading over to this [game](https://www.roblox.com/games/12024634611/Clanware-Registry-Hub) and funding whatever you wish.

### Feedback, Opinions and Queries

There is so much that the executives and the head of the Innovation Panel can do to find areas of weakness in terms of development within the clanning community so it's imperative that the wider community could input and share their knowledge- this can be done by direct messaging the head of the community panel or going to the community category, then the clans and guilds forum, and locating the thread called, "What technologies should Clanware work on next?". Either way works.
