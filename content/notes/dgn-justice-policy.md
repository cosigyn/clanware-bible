## Acceptable Evidence
---
Any verifiable and reliable information that supports the allegations of degenerate charges. This could include screenshots or recordings of messages or social media posts containing personal or sensitive information, or logs from web servers or other online services showing attempts to access or distribute such information. Other forms of evidence that may be considered include witness statements from individuals who have directly experienced or observed the behavior in question, as well as any relevant documentation or records from law enforcement or other regulatory agencies. It is important that all evidence be carefully examined to ensure its authenticity and credibility, and that it be clearly presented and properly contextualized in order to support a fair and impartial decision.

## Appeals Process
---
1. This process is designed to ensure that all decisions are fair and impartial, and that offenders have an opportunity to present any new or additional information that may support their case.
2. To begin the appeals process, the appellant (the individual who has been found guilty) must submit a written appeal to the DGN panel. In this appeal, the appellant must provide evidence and arguments in support of their appeal, such as new evidence that was not available at the time of the original decision, or errors or mistakes made during the original investigation.
3. The DGN panel will then review the appeal and the supporting evidence, and may hold a hearing to allow both the appellant and the respondent (the party representing the DGN rules and guidelines) to present their cases and arguments. After considering all of the evidence and arguments presented, the DGN panel will make a decision on the appeal.
4. If the appeal is successful, the DGN panel may overturn the original decision and impose a different penalty. In general, the success of an appeal will depend on the appellant's ability to provide compelling and convincing evidence and arguments in support of their appeal, and to demonstrate that the original decision was incorrect or unjust. If the appeal is unsuccessful, the original decision will stand and the appellant will be required to abide by the terms of the original decision.
