	- The recorder must show the command execution, and show :logs for validation

2. Cases where someone else is playing on your account are 3 months long, except:
    - If your account was hacked or otherwise compromised, you will not receive a case.
    - If you already have a standard exploit case, the case length will increase by 3 months.

## Appeals Process
---
1. The appellant (the individual who has been found guilty of exploiting or cheating) submits a written appeal to the XPLT panel.
2. The appellant provides evidence and arguments in support of their appeal, such as new evidence that was not available at the time of the original decision, or errors or mistakes made during the original proceedings.
3. The XPLT panel reviews the appeal and the supporting evidence and arguments.
4. The XPLT panel holds a hearing to allow both the appellant and the respondent (the party representing the XPLT rules and guidelines) to present their cases and arguments.
5. After considering the evidence and arguments presented, the XPLT panel makes a decision on the appeal.
6. If the appeal is successful, the XPLT panel may overturn the original decision. In general, the success of an appeal would depend on the appellant's ability to provide compelling and convincing evidence and arguments in support of their appeal, and to demonstrate that the original decision was incorrect or unjust.
7. If the appeal is unsuccessful, the original decision will stand and the appellant will be required to abide by the terms of the original decision.
