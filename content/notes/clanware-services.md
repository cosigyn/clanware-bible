The use of Clanware services can greatly enhance your clan's safety and involvement in the Roblox clanning community. This page will guide you through setting up and using @CLANWARE, utilizing the group checker and banlist, and participating in Clanware events and competitions.

## 2.1. Setting up and using @CLANWARE
---
In order to access and utilize the full range of Clanware services, you must first set up the @CLANWARE bot in your Discord server. This is done by inviting the bot to your server and granting it the appropriate permissions.

Once the bot is set up, you can use the various commands and functions offered by Clanware, such as the group checker and banlist, which are designed to help increase the safety and security of your clan.

### Outline of commands
**/ecase & /dcase**
Search for a specific exploiter or degenerate case on the Clanware Banlist.

**/checkgroup**
Search a Roblox group for exploiters and degenerates.

**/raidrequest**
Search for a raid for your clan in the Clanware Server.

**/axis**
Find exploiters on strike 4+, who are blacklisted from the community.

**/checkevidence**
Provides additional information about a specific case's evidence.

## 2.2. Using the group checker and banlist to increase clan safety
---
The group checker and banlist are two important tools offered by Clanware that can help you keep your clan safe from exploiters and cheaters. The group checker will scan the members of your clan and flag any users who have been banned from the Clanware community for exploiting or cheating.

There is both the discord bot command and ingame group checker.

The banlist, on the other hand, is a database of known exploiters and cheaters within the Roblox community. By using the banlist, you can easily check to see if any potential members of your clan have a history of exploiting or cheating, and make an informed decision about whether or not to allow them to join your clan.

2.3. Participating in Clanware events and competitions
Clanware hosts a variety of events and competitions throughout the year, which provide an opportunity for clans to come together and compete in a friendly and organized manner. These events can be a great way to engage with the Clanware community, build camaraderie among your clan members, and showcase your skills and abilities.

To participate in a Clanware event, simply sign up and follow the rules and guidelines provided by the event organizers. Whether you're a seasoned pro or a newcomer to the world of Roblox clanning, Clanware events are a great way to get involved and have fun!
