#5.1 What is Clanware League
---

Clanware League is a tournament hosted by Clanware in which various sword clans participate against one another, in various maps and modes; all with one similar goal in mind: victory. This tournament occurs on an annual basis. 

 - Game Structure 

Each game consists of two *splits*. These are both separate matches that can take place at different times. Both splits will be on the same map and are a 800 Dualcap terminal.

Your team will **gain one point per split** they win, as there are two splits in a game, this can result in a tie. This is resolved by comparing the collective team KDR for both splits, whichever team has a higher KDR win the game.

Your team will gain one **extra point per game win.**

To summarize;

Gain one point per split win
Gain one point per game win
This means, the following outcomes are possible:

Win both splits: 3 points
Win one split and win by kdr: 2 points
Win one split and lose by kdr: 1 points
Lose both splits: 0 point

 - League Structure

This league follows a *round-robin* structure, meaning you will play against each other team twice, in no particular order.
Leagues are split into two Conferences Alpha and Conference Omega, the top two teams from each Conference will qualify for the knockout rounds.

Swords will be anti ForceTie.

**It is the sole responsibility of the team captains to ensure their game join code is not distributed to the wrong people, this will result in penalties.**

As always, NO exploiters will be permitted to participate.
