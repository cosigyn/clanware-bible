This section will provide information on how Clanware can provide services to the community through its various forms of technology.

#4.1 Clan Technology
---
Clanware provides many platforms for start-up, or already developed, clans to get better technology.

Clanware creates and provides technology which can be found in the development channel of the information category found within the discord server. Keep an eye out for regular updates as new technologies made by developers solely dedicated to Clanware and its goal of benefitting clans are made. 

You can commission developers through the marketplace forum found in the developer guild category of the Clanware discord server. This option allows you to have customised technology to your liking and allows your clans to shine above others- you will, however, have to most likely pay for any services the developer is offering to you.

Another option for getting access to better forms of clan technology is by, again, going through the resources channel found in the developers guilde of the clanware discord server. There is plenty of new resources being opensourced to the community and the best thing about this is that it is all free.

## 4.2 Raid Technology
